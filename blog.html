                <h1 class="mt-5 text-4xl underline mb-6">Question No 1: What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
                <p class="mb-5">DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for web documents that provides a way to interact with the content and structure of an HTML, document as object.</p>
                <p>The purpose of the DOM is to provide a structured representation of a web document that can be accessed and manipulated using programming languages such as JavaScript. The DOM represents the document as a tree-like structure of objects, each object representing a specific part of the document, such as an element, attribute, or text node.</p>
                <h1 class="mt-5 text-4xl underline mb-6">Question No 2:  How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
                <p class="mb-5">To select HTML elements using the DOM, several methods are available. Here are some commonly used DOM methods for selecting HTML elements:</p>
                <ol class="list-decimal ml-10">
                    <li>getElementById()</li>
                    <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
                    <li>getElementsByClassName()</li>
                    <li>querySelector()</li>
                    <li>querySelectorAll()</li>
                </ol>
                <h1 class="mt-5 text-4xl underline mb-6">Question No 3:  What is event bubble?</h1>
                <p class="mb-5">An event bubble is a type of DOM event propagation document object. This is one way that events are handled in the browser. Events are actions performed by the user such as clicking a button, changing a field, etc. Event handlers are used to execute code when a specific type of user interface event occurs, such as when a button is clicked or when a webpage is loaded.</p>
                <h1 class="mt-5 text-4xl underline mb-6">Question No 4:  What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
                <p class="mb-5">A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed when that function completes its work. A callback function is typically used to provide a way for a function to return a result or perform some action after an asynchronous operation has completed.</p>
                <p class="mb-5">Callbacks are commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous operations, such as when making an AJAX request or using setTimeout() or setInterval() to run code at a specified interval. By providing a callback function as an argument to these functions, the program can continue executing other code during the operation and then execute the callback function when the operation completes.</p>
